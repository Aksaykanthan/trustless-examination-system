# Trustless Examination System

## Overview

This project implements a **trustless examination system** built using Python, where results are published via a **verifiable state machine**. The system ensures transparency, immutability, and accountability throughout the examination process. This decentralized approach guarantees that no third party can manipulate the results, creating a system of trust without requiring trusted intermediaries.

## Features

- **Verifiable State Machine**: Results are managed through a state machine that can be verified, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
- **Transparency and Accountability**: Every action in the exam process is tracked and verifiable, eliminating the possibility of tampering.
- **Decentralized Publishing**: Exam results are published on a verifiable ledger, ensuring they remain immutable.
- **Python-based**: The core of the system is built using Python, making it lightweight and easy to extend.

## Architecture

The system operates using a finite state machine, representing different states of the examination process:

1. **Initialized**: The examination setup is completed and verified.
2. **Ongoing**: Exams are being conducted, and submissions are being logged.
3. **Completed**: Exams are closed, and results are computed.
4. **Published**: Results are publicly available and verifiable.

Each state transition is logged, and the results are made accessible in a tamper-proof manner.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trustless-exam-system.git
    cd trustless-exam-system
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Initialize the Examination**: Define the exam parameters and initialize the system in the `Initialized` state.
2. **Run the Examination**: The state machine transitions to `Ongoing` as exams are conducted, logging submissions.
3. **Complete the Examination**: Transition to the `Completed` state, where exam results are processed.
4. **Publish Results**: Results are transitioned to the `Published` state, ensuring they are verifiable by all parties.

## Roadmap

- Implement blockchain-based result publishing for stronger verification.
- Add a user interface for teachers and students to interact with the system.
- Integration with existing quiz platforms.
